- Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest retailer, is facing operational challenges in managing inventory efficiently across its thousands of stores worldwide. With fluctuating customer demand, promotions, and external factors like weather impacting sales, Walmart's operations team is under pressure to ensure optimal stock levels without overspending on excess inventory or losing sales due to stockouts.
- Walmart needs a data-driven inventory optimization solution that minimizes both stockouts and overstocking by forecasting demand based on past sales data. The goal is to develop a scalable approach that adjusts inventory levels dynamically using real-time insights from the analysis.
